      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a Software Engineer with a love for all things tech. Born and
        raised in New York City, I now call the Greater Chicago area my home.
        With over 10 years of experience in the technology industry, I&apos;ve
        had the pleasure of working with all sorts of companies, from Finance to
        Public Relations to SaaS companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion lies in Front End Development and UI Design, where I use my
        expertise to build websites and web applications that not only look
        great but also function well. Whether it&apos;s HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        or frameworks like React, Nodejs, or Ruby on Rails, I&apos;m always up
        for a coding challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me mentoring others both on and
        off the court. I believe in helping people reach their full potential,
        and nothing makes me happier than seeing others succeed. In my free
        time, I love hanging out with family and friends, trying out different
        types of whiskey, and defrazzling with some good old-fashioned video
        games. I&apos;m also a city person at heart, and I love exploring new
        places and seeing what other cities have to offer. So, that&apos;s a bit
        about me! If you&apos;re interested in working together or just want to
        chat about tech, feel free to drop me a line. I&apos;m always up for a
        good conversation!
